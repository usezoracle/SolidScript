# Changelog

All notable changes to SolidScript follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- `solidscript --version` now reads from `package.json` at runtime instead of returning the hardcoded `0.0.1`. Resolves the version-reporting bug introduced in earlier releases.
- **Release workflow hardened against trailing `npm publish` 403s.** `npm publish --provenance` occasionally returns a non-zero exit code after successfully writing to the registry and pushing the provenance attestation to sigstore's transparency log (race between the registry write and the CLI's internal verify check). The release workflow now treats the publish step's exit code as advisory and uses a follow-up `npm view solidscript@$VERSION version` query to determine the real outcome. If the version is on the registry, the workflow proceeds to create the GitHub Release. If it's genuinely missing, the workflow hard-fails. This was discovered while shipping v0.2.2 — the package published successfully but the workflow reported failure, requiring manual `gh release create` to finish the release. v0.2.3 is the first release shipped through the fully automated path.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Auto-pipx fallback** for Slither and Mythril in `solidscript doctor --fix`. Resolution order is now `PATH → Docker → pipx install`. When `pipx` is present and neither a native binary nor a Docker image is available, doctor automatically runs `pipx install slither-analyzer` / `pipx install mythril` instead of just printing the install hint.
- `solidscript doctor` (no `--fix`) now distinguishes between "Docker present" and "pipx present" in its hint text, so users see the exact path that will be tried.

### Fixed
- Removed dead `extract as tarExtract` import from `src/runtime/tool-paths.ts` that was producing a TypeScript declaration emit warning during build.

### Verified
- First release through the Plan B CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions: tag push → `bun run build` → `npm publish --provenance --access public` → GitHub Release with tarball). 0.2.1 was the last manual publish.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- `solidscript.config.example.ts` renamed to `solidscript.config.example.mjs` to match what `solidscript init` writes
- `package.json` metadata filled in (author, repository URL, homepage, bugs)
- Docs updated to reflect the 9-gate pipeline (Mythril added as Gate 4 in 0.2.0; stale 8-gate references corrected throughout)

### Removed
- Dev-internal `SECURITY_SYSTEM_REPORT.md` (content folded into `docs/details.md` §8)
- Stray `contracts/TrillionToken.ts` artifact at repo root
- Working dev `solidscript.config.ts` — the `.example.mjs` is the template users copy

### Added
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `LANDING.md` — structured marketing-page content for the website

### Fixed
- `tests/fixtures/RequireToError.ts` moved to `tests/contracts/` (consolidated test-contracts under a single folder); test import updated

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Mythril gate** as Gate 4 of the verify pipeline (symbolic execution, opt-in via `--deep`)
- **`solidscript doctor --fix`** — auto-fetches Foundry binaries to `~/.solidscript/bin/` and pulls Slither/Mythril Docker images, making the toolchain self-contained after one command
- **Tool resolver** (`src/runtime/tool-paths.ts`) — every spawn site goes through a unified resolver with native + Docker fallback
- **OpenZeppelin v5 bundled** as a regular dependency (was peer dep in 0.1.x; now `npm install solidscript` brings it automatically)
- **Library entry point** at `src/index.ts` — programmatic API (`parseContractFiles`, `emitProgram`, `validateProgram`, `optimizeProgram`, `compileSolidity`, plus all IR types)
- **Etherscan v2 multichain verification** — one API key works for Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, ZkSync, Ethereum, every testnet
- **Browser-wallet deploy** (`--browser` flag, default when no `--wallet`) — local HTTP bridge at `localhost:7654`, signs via MetaMask/Rabby/Coinbase Wallet
- **User-level config** at `~/.solidscript/config.json` (mode 0600) — `solidscript config set etherscan-key …` subcommand
- **GitHub Actions CI** — test matrix (node 18/20/22) + pack-smoke + security gates; release workflow on `v*` tag
- **`docs/details.md`** (14-section guide), **`docs/openapi.yaml`** (browser-deploy HTTP surface), **`docs/cli-commands.yaml`** (auto-generated CLI manifest)

### Changed
- Build pipeline switched from `tsc` to Bun's bundler — produces a tighter dist
- CLI shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bun` → `#!/usr/bin/env node` so the published package works under any Node-based runtime
- `solidscript init` now writes `solidscript.config.mjs` instead of `.ts` (Node ESM can load `.mjs` directly without a TS runtime)
- `solidscript verify` consolidated `--no-fuzz`, `--no-smt`, etc. into a single `--skip <gates>` flag
- `solidscript deploy` smart defaults: auto-`--browser` when no `--wallet` given, auto-verify when `etherscan-key` configured

### Fixed
- `attestation.ts:readSolidscriptVersion()` now resolves SolidScript's own `package.json` via `import.meta.url` (was reading the user's project `package.json`)
- Custom-errors pass no longer produces double-negation (`if (!!emergencyMode)` → `if (emergencyMode)`)
- Unary operator emit wraps its operand in parens when needed (`!x >= y` → `!(x >= y)`)
- TS-only `Number(i)` / `BigInt(i)` casts stripped during parsing (don't leak into Solidity)
- `CheckedAddress` and `Bytes32` branded TS types alias to `address`/`bytes32` in generated Solidity
- `@invariant` decorator implies `view` mutability
- View-mutation rule no longer false-positives on local variable reassignment

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

Initial public commit. TypeScript → Solidity transpiler with 8-gate security pipeline (gate 4 added in 0.2.0), forge bridge, examples, plugin API, attestation bundle, source maps, gasdiff, audit-pack, multi-chain deploy. See README and `docs/details.md` for the full feature surface.
